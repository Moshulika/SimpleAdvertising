**Simple-Advertising**

A plugin made for Survival or RPG servers, but surely compatible for all multiplayer gametypes like SkyBlock, Hardcore Survival, or any other genre that has a strong point in item, skill, xp or land trading. Any player can make it's own advertisment on the public chat, in a friendly and easy way. You can put prices in money or points, set cooldowns so the chat isn't constantly spammed, broadcast messages to your players, we recently added a auto-advertising feature, and more to come. 1.18 ready, it is very configurable, and you can really use it in ingenious ways that I'd like to see.
